1. **Create User Account:**
   - The user initiates the process by signing up with basic details (email, password, etc.) through a "Create User" endpoint.
   - After successful registration, generate a verification code and send it to the user's email address.

2. **Verify Email:**
   - Provide a verification link in the email sent to the user.
   - When the user clicks the link, it should lead to a "Verify Email" endpoint.
   - Verify the code from the link against the one stored during registration. If it matches, mark the email as verified.

3. **Update Profile:**
   - After email verification, direct the user to a "Complete Profile" page where they can update their profile information.
   - Collect information like name, bio, and profile image.
   - Store this information in the database associated with the user's account.

4. **Select User Type:**
   - On the same "Complete Profile" page, include an option for the user to select their user type. You can present this as a dropdown menu or a set of radio buttons with options like "Hostel Owner," "Student," or "Vendor."

5. **Frontend Redirection:**
   - When the user selects their user type and submits the form, the frontend handles the redirection based on the user's selection.
   - Use JavaScript or your frontend framework to capture the selected user type and conditionally redirect the user to the respective registration endpoint or page.

6. **User Type Registration:**
   - On the respective registration page, collect additional information specific to the selected user type. This might include different fields or details required for each type.
   - Create the user type-specific records in the database.

7. **Complete Registration:**
   - After successful registration of the selected user type, redirect the user to a "Registration Complete" or "Dashboard" page.
   - Confirm and display a message indicating that their registration is complete.

8. **Authentication and Access:**
   - Ensure the user can access features and functionalities specific to their selected user type after completing registration.

By implementing this approach, you allow the frontend to handle the redirection logic based on the user's selected user type, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
